## Introduction

This folder contains examples of how to use FSIC for macroeconomic modelling.

**Note that, in contrast to the README.md files, the Markdown files that define
  models for FSIC are compatible with
  [Pandoc Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html),
  which is an extended version of Markdown. GitHub will not necessarily render
  these files as intended owing to the differences in standards, including the
  absence of support for LaTeX in GitHub Flavored Markdown.**
