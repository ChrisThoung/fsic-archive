## Introduction

This folder contains implementations of the models in Almon (2014) as examples
of how to specify models using Markdown files. As well as containing the code to
generate and run each model, the files can be converted to other formats by
programs such as [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
