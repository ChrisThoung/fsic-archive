========
FSIC subpackage for model-solution optimisation.

This subpackage contains tools to improve the solution performance of a model
e.g. to re-arrange the order of a system of equations to be 'more recursive', in
order to reduce the number of iterations to convergence by the Gauss-Seidel
method.

The subpackage contains the following module:

* `order`, to provide tools to reorder a system of equations
